# Handler Not Working - Diagnosis and Solution

## 🔍 **Issue Identified**

Your custom `handler.py` is **not being called** by the RunPod worker. The logs show the worker is using the base handler directly instead of your wrapper.

## 🚨 **Evidence from Logs**

Looking at your build logs, I notice:
1. **No diagnostic messages** from our handler.py module loading
2. **No custom handler calls** - the worker goes straight to ComfyUI execution
3. **Missing worker_metadata** in the final result

## 🔧 **Root Cause Analysis**

The issue is likely one of these:

1. **Module Import Conflict**: Base image may have its own handler module
2. **File Permissions**: Handler file may not be executable/readable
3. **Python Path Issues**: Module not found in expected location
4. **Timing Issues**: Handler loaded before dependencies are available

## ✅ **Solution Implemented**

I've added comprehensive diagnostics to identify the exact issue:

### 1. **Enhanced Handler with Diagnostics**
- Added module-level logging to show when handler.py is loaded
- Added detailed logging in the handler function
- Added error handling for import failures

### 2. **Build-Time Verification**
- Added handler file verification in Dockerfile
- Added test script to verify handler works during build
- Added diagnostic script to check runtime status

### 3. **Runtime Diagnostics**
- Added diagnostic script that runs at startup
- Checks for file existence, permissions, and imports
- Verifies both our handler and base rp_handler

## 🧪 **Testing the Fix**

After rebuilding with these changes, you should see:

1. **Build logs** showing handler verification
2. **Startup logs** showing diagnostic output
3. **Job execution logs** showing our custom handler being called
4. **Result** containing `worker_metadata` field

## 📋 **Next Steps**

1. **Rebuild** the image with the updated Dockerfile
2. **Check build logs** for handler verification messages
3. **Check startup logs** for diagnostic output
4. **Run a test job** and verify worker_metadata appears in results

## 🔍 **If Still Not Working**

If the handler still isn't being called, the diagnostic output will show:
- Whether the file exists and has correct permissions
- Whether Python can import the module
- Whether there are conflicting handlers
- What's actually in the /app directory

This will help identify the exact issue and provide a targeted fix.
